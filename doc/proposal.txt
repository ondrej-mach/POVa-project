Project proposal - Car license plate recognition

Authors: xlanro00, xmacho12

We aim to create a CLI based program that will take an image as the input.
It will output bounding-box coordinates of any detected license plates and their text contents.
Our environment of choice is python with openCV library.
The license plate will be found using edge detection to highlight the plate area.
Then, we will use contour analysis to find potential license plate regions.
Finally, OCR will be used to read the license plate number.
